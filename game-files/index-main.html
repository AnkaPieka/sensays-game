          For years, you've train for this moment... Finally, it's time ! Time
          to show your talent to the legendary and mighty Ishikawa sensei.
        </p>
        <p>
          He's well known to be the best teacher in all Okinawa... and the
          grumpiest one, too. With him, no second chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll have to earn his respect reproducing his moves perfectly. If
          you're lucky - and talented - maybe he'll accept you as a student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each technique is linked to a keyboard arrow. Remember them all...
        </p>
        <div id="moves-icons">
          <div class="icon-pres">
            <img
              class="move-icon"
              src="./keyboard-right-arrow-button.png"
              alt="right arrow shuto"
            />
            <p>
              This move is called <i>shuto</i>. It's an open hand technique,
              meant to be like a blade.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="icon-presentation">
            <img
              class="move-icon"
              src="./up-arrow-key.png"
              alt="up arrow oizuki"
            />
            <p>This move is called <i>oi zuki</i>. It's a stepping punch.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="icon-pres">
            <img
              class="move-icon"
              src="./keyboard-left-arrow-button.png"
              alt="left arrow mawashigeri"
            />
            <p>
              <i>Mawashi geri</i> is actually quite famous : it's a round kick.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="icon-pres">
            <img
              class="move-icon"
              src="./down-chevron.png"
              alt="down arrow maegeri"
            />
            <p>Finally, <i>Mae geri</i>, is a front kick.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Once you'll be inside Ishikawa sensei's dojo, you'll be able to
          indicate your level : white belt, brown belt or black belt. Choose
          wisely as you won't be able to change your level until you complete
          the serie... or loose.
