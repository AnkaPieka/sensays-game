          For years, you've trained for this moment... Finally, it's time ! Time
          to show your talent to the legendary and mighty Ishikawa sensei.
        </p>
        <p>
          Known to be the best karate teacher in all Okinawa - and the grumpiest
          one too -, he's quite severe. With him, no second chance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For him to accept you as a student, you'll have to earn his respect
          reproducing his moves perfectly. If you're lucky - and talented -
          maybe he'll take you in.
        </p>
        <p>
          He will yell - he always yells - karate techniques name. Each
          technique is linked to a keyboard arrow and to a color. Remember them
          all...
        </p>
        <div id="moves-icons">
          <div class="icon-presentation">
            <img
              class="arrowkey-icon shuto"
              src="./img/keyboard-right-arrow-button.png"
              alt="right arrow shuto"
            />
            <p>
              This move is called <i>shuto</i>. It's an open hand technique,
              meant to cut like a blade.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="icon-presentation">
            <img

              src="./img/up-arrow-key.png"
              alt="up arrow oizuki"
            />
            <p>This move is called <i>oi zuki</i>. It's a stepping punch.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="icon-presentation">
            <img
              class="arrowkey-icon mawashigeri"

              alt="left arrow mawashigeri"
            />
            <p>
              <i>Mawashi geri</i> is actually quite famous: it's a round kick.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="icon-presentation">
            <img
              class="arrowkey-icon maegeri"
              src="./img/down-chevron.png"
              alt="down arrow maegeri"
            />
            <p>Finally, <i>Mae geri</i>, is a front kick.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Ishikawa is severe, but he's not a monster. First, he will give you
          ONE order. If you manage to reproduce it, he will repeat the first
          order and add another one. And so on, until the end of the serie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful : you will ALWAYS have 3 seconds maximum to reproduce the
          sequence. After 3 seconds, Ishikawa sensei will loose patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you'll be inside the dojo, you'll be able to indicate your level
          : white belt, brown belt or black belt. Choose wisely as you won't be
          able to change your level until you complete the serie... or loose.
